I have been a teacher for most of my professional life. Before starting my phd studies in 2003, I briefly worked as a teacher in secondary/high school teaching courses in Dutch and General studies ("Project Algemene Vakken"). I also obtained my teacher accreditation from Ghent University in 2003. Currently, I'm teach courses on Statistics, Corpus Linguistics, Historical English Linguistics, and Iconicity. And I'm also involved in various courses related to research methodology, language variation and change and general linguistics. Outside academia, I've been teaching the art of karate at my Seikan Dojo for over 20 years. I'm ranked shidoin in Koryu Uchinadi Kenpo-Jutsu under hanshi Patrick McCarthy (10th dan Koryu Uchinadi Kenpo-Jutsu). Teaching is who I am or what I've become.

A pedagogical reflection. One distinction that I've come to appreciate deeply is the one between teaching and lecturing. Presenting a slide deck or reading course notes in front of an audience is pretty easy; teaching is hard. Setting goals, designing lesson plans, and trying to get the best out of every student requires a deep commitment and is best fostered through years of experience.

The key ingredients that have worked best for me are having a clear overall structure, well-defined learning goals, and a challenging yet safe learning environment. My teaching is mostly interactive, task-based, with lots of pair work. 

And just being able to tell a good story, arguably the most underrated teaching skill in the age of slide deck teaching. I mostly agree with the claim that "PowerPoint is the coward's choice" (Clifford Stoll, 1999, Hight Tech Heretic. Doubleday. p. 180), Slides are useful visualisation tools, but terrible when read as mere bullet lists.
