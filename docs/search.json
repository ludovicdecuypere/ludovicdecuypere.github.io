    "text": "I have been a teacher for most of my professional life. Before starting my phd studies in 2003, I briefly worked as a teacher in secondary/high school teaching courses in Dutch and General studies (“Project Algemene Vakken”). I also obtained my teacher accreditation from Ghent University in 2003. Currently, I’m teach courses on Statistics, Corpus Linguistics, Historical English Linguistics, and Iconicity. And I’m also involved in various courses related to research methodology, language variation and change and general linguistics. Outside academia, I’ve been teaching the art of karate at my Seikan Dojo for over 20 years. I’m ranked shidoin in Koryu Uchinadi Kenpo-Jutsu under hanshi Patrick McCarthy (10th dan Koryu Uchinadi Kenpo-Jutsu). Teaching is who I am or what I’ve become.\n\n\n\nKwantitatieve onderzoekstechnieken taalwetenschap: Ludovic De Cuypere - © UGent, foto Christophe Vander Eecken\n\n\nA pedagogical reflection. One distinction that I’ve come to appreciate deeply is the one between teaching and lecturing. Presenting a slide deck or reading course notes in front of an audience is pretty easy; teaching is hard. Setting goals, designing lesson plans, and trying to get the best out of every student requires a deep commitment and is best fostered through years of experience.\nThe key ingredients that have worked best for me are having a clear overall structure, well-defined learning goals, and a challenging yet safe learning context. My teaching is interactive, task-based, and incorporates lots of pair work in class. And just being able to tell a good story, arguably the most underrated teaching skill in the age of PPT.\nOver the years, I’ve also witnessed so-called “grade inflation.” Call me naive – I’ll happily trade any cynicism for some youthful naïveté – but my gut-based Bayesian a priori explanation for this (undeniable) trend is that university education has improved, not because expectations have lowered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBordeaux\n\n\n\nPresentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBordeaux\n\n\n\nPresentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Never been a one-trick pony. I have always been blessed with colleagues who generously allowed me to play in their backyards. Collaboration, streamlining ideas and projects, creating synergy, and trying to add a piece to the research puzzle that creates more than the sum total of the individual pieces – this is what fuels my passion as a researcher and research consultant. My personal line of research has always been – and always will be – diverse. Optionality and serendipity are what drive me forward. One price to pay in today’s super-organized and tightly planned research culture is a loss of serendipity: so many beautiful young minds following the protocol and not having time to mess around."

    "text": "Iconicity\nMy PhD involved an epistemological study of iconicity in language, the results of which were published in Limiting the Iconic (Benjamins, 2008). Building on views by E. Coseriu, U. Eco, G. Sonesson, K. Willems, and S. Levinson, my main idea is that a principled distinction must be made between similarity and iconicity. I believe this is a fundamental epistemological distinction that has not yet been fully appreciated in the literature. I got to summarize this idea in the chapter “The explanatory power of iconicity in language” in The Oxford Handbook of Iconicity in Language (Oxford University Press, 2026)."

    "text": "Syntactic alternations\nMy second line of research deals with alternating constructions, or so-called “unfree variation” (A. Zwicky). This involves the study of optionality in language: formal differences that do not seem to be make any obvious semantic difference. I have studied phenomena such as: The dative and ditransitive alternations, Zero-that complementizer alternation, Differential infinitive marking, Ergativity and the passive alternation, English modal verbs. With my many collaborators, I examined these phenomena in various languages and from multiple perspectives (diachrony, first and second, language acquisition). Methodologically, I’ve mainly followed a corpus-based approach.\nTheoretically, my work is situated in the functional-structuralist tradition (Saussure, Humboldt, Coseriu, Willems). My “thematic” (G. Holton) or “axiomatic” presuppositions include: The existence of a language system of signs or constructions; the sign is fundamentally arbitrary; a principled distinction between semantics (monosemy) and pragmatics; the three layers of system, norm, and usage; language ís cognition; speaking is a creative activity, and corpus data is the product of that activity."

In these studies, we add artificial markers (such as -olp or -u) to English test sentences and track participants’ eye movements to examine how these markers influence attention, and how this affects awareness and acquisition. Several papers from this project are currently under review. A systematic review has already been published as Knell et al. (2025)."

He completed his MA in Germanic Languages and Literature from UGent in 2001, followed by a PhD in Germanic Languages and Literature from the same university in 2007.\nHis doctoral dissertation, published in 2008 as Limiting the Iconic with John Benjamins, involved an epistemological investigation of iconicity in language. He served as a postdoctoral fellow with the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) from 2007 until 2013, working on a corpus-based investigation of the history of the English dative alternation.\nHis research has focused on alternating syntactic constructions, which he has studied from multiple perspectives and in various languages. He has contributed to theoretical and epistemological aspects of linguistic debate, such as the application of evolutionary theory concepts to language change (exaptation), the conceptual nature of (prepositional) semantics, iconicity as a functional explanation, and the grammatical status of alternating syntactic constructions. He has further contributed to the methodological design and statistical analysis of multiple studies. An advocate of Open Science, he has published various datasets on TROLLing, a curated repository under DataverseNo."
