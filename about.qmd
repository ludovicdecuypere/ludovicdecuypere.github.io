His doctoral dissertation, published in 2008 as *Limiting the Iconic* with John Benjamins, involved an epistemological investigation of iconicity in language. He served as a postdoctoral fellow with the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) from 2007 until 2013, working on a corpus-based investigation of the history of the English dative alternation.

His research has focused on alternating syntactic constructions, which he has studied from multiple perspectives and in various languages. He has contributed to theoretical and epistemological aspects of linguistic debate, such as the application of evolutionary theory concepts to language change (exaptation), the conceptual nature of (prepositional) semantics, iconicity as a functional explanation, and the grammatical status of alternating syntactic constructions. He has further contributed to the methodological design and statistical analysis of multiple studies.

Together with co-supervisors Esli Struys and Alex Housen (VUB), and PhD students Georgia Knell and Saioa Cipitria, he's currently involved in two research projects studying the effect of saliency in language acquisition. Adding artificial markers to English test sentences, we track participants' eye movements to examine how these markers draw attention and how this further affects awareness and ultimately acquisition. Several papers from this project are currently under review. A systematic review has already been published as Knell et al. (2025).
