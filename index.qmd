Welcome to my forest! My name is Ludovic De Cuypere \[lydovik də kœyːpərə\] and I am an Associate Professor in English Linguitics at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and  a Research Consultant at the Linguistics Department of Ghent University (UGent). 

As a researcher I've worked on various topics including iconicity, alternating constructions, constructional semantics, and salience. 

I teach courses on Historical English Linguistics (VUB), Corpus Linguistics (VUB), Iconicity in Language (VUB) and statistics (UGent). As a research consultant, I provide methodological support to students and researchers. I'm also the co-organiser of the summer school Methods in Language Sciences (UGent). 

Outside work, you may find me amongst friends and family, or in the Seikan Dojo. 

Happy discoveries!
