Welcome to my forest! 

My name is Ludovic De Cuypere \[lydovik də kœyːpərə\] and I am an Associate Professor in English Linguitics at Vrije Universiteit Brussel and  a Research Support Officer at the Linguistics Department of Ghent University. 

As a researcher I've worked on various topics including iconicity, alternating constructions, constructional semantics, and salience. I teach courses on Historical English Linguistics, Corpus Linguistics, Iconicity in Language and Statistics. As a Research Support Officer, I provide methodological consultancy to students and researchers. I'm also the co-organiser of the summer school Methods in Language Sciences (UGent). 

Outside work, you may find me amongst friends and family, or in the Seikan Dojo. 

Happy discoveries!
