Welcome! My name is Ludovic De Cuypere and I'm an Associate Professor in English Linguitics at Vrije Universiteit Brussel and a Research Consultant at the Linguistics Department of Ghent University. I teach courses on Statistics, Corpus Linguistics, Advanced English Linguistics, and Historical English Linguistics. Here I share some of my academic work and teaching materials in the spirit of Open Science. Outside work, you may find me amongst friends and family or in the Seikan Dojo. Happy discoveries!
