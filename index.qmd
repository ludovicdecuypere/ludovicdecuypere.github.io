Welcome! My name is Ludovic De Cuypere and I'm an associate professor in English Linguitics at Vrije Universiteit Brussel and a research consultant at the Linguistics Department of Ghent University. I teach courses on Statistics, Corpus Linguistics and Historical English Linguistics. Here I share some of my work in the spirit of Open Science. Oustide work, you may find me amongst friends and family or in the Seikan Dojo. Happy discoveries!
