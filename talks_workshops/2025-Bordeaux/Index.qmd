# Abstract

The relationship between pervasive variability and the structuralist “one-form-one-meaning” 
principle, a postulate endorsed across various theoretical frameworks, continues to spark debate. In 
an earlier chapter of this debate, Newmeyer (1983: 116) astutely observed that much of the debate 
hinges on how the notion of “meaning” is conceptualized (cf. Weber & Kopf 2023: 3). Newmeyer’s
observation remains pertinent, and we accordingly aim to advance the discussion by offering a more 
theoretical contribution.

Specifically, we advocate for a "Three-Layer Approach" to meaning, a framework rooted in Coserian 
structural-functional linguistics and neo-Gricean pragmatics (Coseriu 1989, Levinson 2000, Belligh & 
Willems 2021). This approach differentiates between (i) encoded language-specific meanings, (ii) 
conventionalized senses, and (iii) specific readings in discourse. Furthermore, we draw on Coseriu’s 
(1989) distinction between polyvalence (a single expression with multiple senses) and polymorphy
(“grammatical synonymy”, i.e. more than one expression for a single encoded meaning). 

We elaborate on De Vaere’s (2023) analysis of the German dative alternation and explore its 
applicability to the English dative alternation. The German and English alternations are illustrated 
below:

(1) a. Er schickt seiner Mutter einen Brief. (IOC)
    b. Er schickt einen Brief an seine Mutter. (POC)
(2) a. He sends his mother a letter. (DOC)
    b. He sends a letter to his mother. (POC)

The German and English ditransitive alternation are similar. Both involve a RECIPIENT that can be 
expressed with or without a preposition. Corpus evidence further indicates that both alternations 
are also associated with similar motivating factors related to the THEME and RECIPIENT (pronominality, definiteness, length, etc.) (De Vaere 2023: 95). However, there is an important formal difference. 

The German alternants are “indirective constructions” (Malchukov, Haspelmath, & Comrie 2010):
the German non-prepositional alternant is not a Double Object Construction (DOC) but an Indirect 
Object Construction (IOC), sharing its alignment pattern with the Prepositional Object Construction 
(POC).

The three-layer analysis conceptualizes the German ditransitive construction as an overarching 
AGENT-THEME-GOAL (ATG) constructeme, with IOC and POC as two “allostructions”. A distributional 
analysis indicates that neither IOC nor POC are confined to a CAUSED POSSESSION and CAUSED MOTION
meaning, respectively. The difference between IOC and POC involves polymorphy of the GOAL
argument within the constructeme. A similar analysis applies to the English dative alternation, but in 
English the polymorphy of the GOAL argument coincides with two alternating word order patterns to 
a much larger extent than in a case language such as German.
